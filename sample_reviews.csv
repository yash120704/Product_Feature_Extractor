review
The camera quality is outstanding, even in low light conditions.
Battery life lasts more than a day with heavy usage, really impressed!
The screen is sharp and vibrant, but the fingerprint sensor is a bit slow.
Charging speed is excellent, but the phone heats up quickly during gaming.
I love the sleek design, but the speaker volume is too low.
Performance is smooth while multitasking, no lags at all.
Storage is sufficient, but I wish it had expandable memory.
Face unlock is fast, but sometimes struggles in low light.
The UI is clean and responsive, but thereâ€™s too much bloatware pre-installed.
Build quality feels premium, but the back is prone to fingerprints.
